# HelpQL
An experimental AI tool that can write a sql query based on the files provided


### Getting Started
```
$ mkdir source
$ npm i
$ # Add csv files to source folder prior to executing next command
$ npm run build:run
```
-- This application requires OpenAI credientials to perform the request
[Open AI API Reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

```
/**
 * Open AI
 */
const config = new Configuration({
    organization: process.env.ORG,
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
})

```

### Expected behavior
```
$ mkdir source
$ npm i
$ # Add csv files to source folder prior to executing next command
$ npm run build:run

:👨🏾‍💻: Tell me how I should write this query?
Can you get the all players who's points are over 30 in the 2020 season?
